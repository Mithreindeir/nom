# For this two work, I need to check parent frame for
# Variable definitions (fact is undefined when its called inside fact)
# And make frames save themselves when they are stepped into
# and then restore themselves when they are exited
# This will allow recursion

# Currently this throws "undefined function" error

# UNSTABLE
